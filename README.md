# Heart Disease Prediction
## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using **Machine Learning models**. We implement two models:
- **Random Forest**
- **Logistic Regression**

The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation using **cross-validation**, and **ROC curve plotting** for model comparison.

## Files
